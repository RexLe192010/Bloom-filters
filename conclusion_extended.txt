In scenarios where space efficiency is critical and occasional false positives are acceptable, the Bloom filter provides a significant advantage over a traditional hashtable. The fixed 48-byte memory usage for the Bloom filter, regardless of the number of insertions, demonstrates that it is an ideal choice for applications where memory resources are limited. Conversely, the hashtable consumes a much larger and increasing amount of memory as more elements are inserted, making it less suitable for large-scale or memory-constrained environments.
